# Networks

Montana State University: CSCI-466 Networks

Instructor: Dr. Mike Witte

Course Objective: Learn how to implement and understand networking protocols.


## Projects Overview
Brief Description of each programming project. 

It is worth mentioning that each assignment required a new parter.

### Project 1: Application Layer & Transport Layer
[Project 1](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/CSCI466Program1.git) focuses on TCP/UDP connection between a client and host. The program itself is Battleship.

### Project 2: Transport Layer, Reliable Data Transfer
[Project 2](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/CSCI466_Program2.git) uses TCP/UDP along with Reliable Data Transfer Protocol to learn different ways packets are handled when lost or are received unordered.

This involved packetizing, packet segmentation, and handleing missing/unordered packets in an appropriate manner.

### Project 3: Network Layer, Data Plane
The objective of [Project 3](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/Assignment3_CSCI466.git) is to understand the Data Plane. The project requires a network to be initialized, packets to be segmented and a routing table to be implemented. 

Project 3 requirements are:
* Packetize streams at network layer
* Implement packet segmentation
* Implement forwarding through routing tables


### Project 4: Network Layer & Link Layer, Control Plane
[Project 4](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/CSCI_466_Program_4.git) is to focus on the control aspect of router forwarding, more specifically distance-vector routing protocol.


The requirments of project 4 are:
* Design a control packet
* Implement a distance-vector routing protocol
* Control routing using link costs

### Project 5: Network Layer & Link Layer, Multi Protocol Label Switching
[Project 5](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/CSCI_466_Program_5.git) focuses on MPLS primarily in a simulation fashion.


The requirments of project 5 are:
* Implement MPLS forwarding on the routers
* Control forwarding paths using MPLS labels
* Implement priority based forwarding on routers
